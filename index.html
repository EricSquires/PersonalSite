      I've decided to put together a personal site in order to throw some of my development thoughts up somewhere as well as offer a diversion from the problems I've been working through in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850">Cracking the Coding Interview 6<sup>th</sup> Edition</a>. When I started this project, it had been a few weeks straight of putting in time every day working through problems in the book. I do best when I'm working on a variety of things so it was about time to tackle something completely different.

      If you're interested in the tech that went into this site, you can refer to the <a href="about.html">about the site</a> page. There's the <a href="resume.html">résumé</a> page which is self explanatory. In the future, I hope to add a blog component, but I want to try to write that portion myself since it's not a particularly pressing need and it should be a nice project to tackle.

      As it turns out, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> doesn't offer email routing for droplets so at the moment, I'm not listing a contact address. It's probably paranoid of me, but I'd prefer to list something other than my personal address (even though that's easy enough to find on the site). For now, please contact me on <a href="https://github.com/EricSquires">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-squires/21/b8a/707">LinkedIn</a> - links to these can be found in the footer of any page.
