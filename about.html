      My goal with this site was primarily to establish a web presence for myself and to have a place to put together something a little more impressive than just a standard résumé. At the outset, I thought that meant building everything from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is something I think we all tend to fall prey to from time to time - not invented here syndrome. After about an hour of trying to muddle through some HTML and CSS by hand, I realized I just shouldn't fight my desire to seek out and use some better tools. After all, reuse is one of the major tenets of software engineering.

      At first, I was looking for a static site generator. After all, this site will be serving up static content and nothing more - no sense using anything more dynamic than that. I settled on Jekyll since it seems to be well regarded and I <em>did</em> find it very useful. After using Jekyll to author a page though, I wasn't happy with how much it was doing for me. I had gone too far in the other direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is when I finally adopted my current workflow. I've settled on NPM, Grunt and Bootstrap to give me some powerful authoring tools while still allowing me to scratch my development itch.
