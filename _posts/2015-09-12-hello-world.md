I've decided to put together a personal site in order to throw some of my development thoughts up somewhere as well as offer a diversion from the problems I've been working through in [Cracking the Coding Interview 6<sup>th</sup> Edition][ctci]. It's been 2-3 weeks that I've been putting in time every day to work through the book so I need a change of pace to keep from burning out.

Since this is my first post, let's run through my current and recent efforts to start producing widely available proof that I won't panic when presented with FizzBuzz. Hopefully my writing will speak to my abilities outside of software development.

###Cracking the Coding Interview

These problems have been a nice change of pace from my day job cranking out line of business programs. I'd forgotten how rewarding it can be tackling clearly defined problems that appear on the surface to be very simple.

I've already tackled the chapters on arrays, linked lists and stacks and queues (for the most part anyway). I'm glad to be working on the more meaty issues in the Trees and Graphs chapter, but the early chapters were a good way to ease back into this sort of development. One of the most useful things I gleaned from my work on the first few chapters was how slow my intial process was.

I started off putting every question into its own project, implementing multiple solutions and doing fairly extensive performance testing. Once I realized how long this was taking compared to just how many chapters and questions are contained in CtCI, I decided to drop the multiple implementations, the performance testing and moved to a workflow where each chapter is in a single solution with one project for questions, one for tests and one for common data structure implementations.

###Git

I've been using version control since college. Back then I was working with one professor and a team of 3 other students which meant that a centralized VCS was generally just fine. Most of the time the things each person was working on didn't touch the same areas as other people's work so conflicts were fairly uncommon.

In my current day job I've been the sole developer for 4 years which has always meant that I've got about ten times as much work as I can keep up with. That reality drove me to adopt Team Foundation Server as our VCS when I started our C# development. At the time I just wanted a solution as familiar to me as possible so I didn't have to deal with too much learning since I was simultaneously learning C#, WPF and strengthening my SQL skills.

Since I made the decision to seek more challenging work, I wanted to get together some sort of portfolio of work I could show to potential employers. Of course, it's hard not to go with GitHub for that in this day and age so I took it as an opportunity to learn Git and finally get experience with a distributed VCS.

I have to admit, I love it. It's been so easy to get started with and as I've been digging into things like the GitHub flow, I'm getting more and more anxious to finally move into a team environment where I can be part of something more collaborative. This is a scratch I'm sure could be itched by finding an interesting open source project to contribute to, but I haven't had luck with that yet. For now, my focus is on finding an interesting job to move to when my tenure with my current company is up.
